    <div id="q1" class="question">Q1: Which of the following are examples of the null set?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>(i)</strong> Set of odd natural numbers divisible by 2: This is a null set since no odd number can be divisible by 2.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)</strong> Set of even prime numbers: This set is not null since it contains the number 2. Hence, the set is {2}.</p>
      <p><strong>(iii)</strong> {x : x is a natural number, x &lt; 5 and x &gt; 7}: No natural number can be less than 5 and greater than 7 simultaneously, so it's a null set.</p>
      <p><strong>(iv)</strong> {y : y is a point common to any two parallel lines}: Parallel lines never meet, so the set is null.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q2" class="question">Q2: Which of the following sets are finite or infinite?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>(i)</strong> The set of months of a year: Finite set with 12 elements.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)</strong> {1, 2, 3, ...}: Infinite set as numbers continue endlessly.</p>
      <p><strong>(iii)</strong> {1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100}: Finite set with 100 elements.</p>
      <p><strong>(iv)</strong> The set of positive integers greater than 100: Infinite set.</p>
      <p><strong>(v)</strong> The set of prime numbers less than 99: Finite set.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q3" class="question">Q3: State whether each of the following set is finite or infinite:</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>(i)</strong> Set of lines parallel to the x-axis: Infinite set.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)</strong> Set of letters in the English alphabet: Finite set with 26 elements.</p>
      <p><strong>(iii)</strong> Set of numbers which are multiples of 5: Infinite set.</p>
      <p><strong>(iv)</strong> Set of animals living on earth: Finite set (though large, it's countable).</p>
      <p><strong>(v)</strong> Set of circles passing through origin (0,0): Infinite set.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q4" class="question">Q4: In the following, state whether A = B or not:</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>(i)</strong> A = {a, b, c, d}, B = {d, c, b, a}: Yes, both sets contain the same elements.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)</strong> A = {4, 8, 12, 16}, B = {8, 4, 16, 18}: No, B contains 18 which is not in A.</p>
      <p><strong>(iii)</strong> A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, B = {x : x is a positive even integer ≤10}: Yes, both sets represent the same elements.</p>
      <p><strong>(iv)</strong> A = {x : x is a multiple of 10}, B = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...}: No, B includes non-multiples of 10.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q5" class="question">Q5: Are the following pair of sets equal? Give reasons.</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>(i)</strong> A = {2, 3}, B = {x : x is solution of x² + 5x + 6 = 0}: The equation factors as (x+2)(x+3)=0, solutions are {-2, -3}, so A ≠ B.</p>
      <p><strong>(ii)</strong> A = {x : x is a letter in the word "FOLLOW"}, B = {y : y is a letter in the word "WOLF"}: A = {F, O, L, W}, B = {W, O, L, F}, thus A = B.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q6" class="question">Q6: From the sets given below, select equal sets:</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A = {2, 4, 8, 12}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, C = {4, 8, 12, 14}, D = {3, 1, 4, 2}, E = {-1, 1}, F = {0, a}, G = {1, -1}, H = {0, 1}</p>
      <p>Equal sets: E = G and B = D.</p>
